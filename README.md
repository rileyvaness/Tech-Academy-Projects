<h2> Thanks for visiting my GitHub </h2> 
<p> This year I was incredibly fortunate to carve out a couple months from my schedule and focus on learning about the world of Software Development as a remote student with The Tech Academy. Going in, I really didn't feel all that confident talking about Software related issues with others; I left Tech Academy with a heightened confidence to feel fully engaged when talking with members not only of the Software community, but of the Tech community as a whole. I think the largest takeaway that I received from my time as a student at the Tech Academy was the ability to find out solutions to problems on my own. The holistic pedagogy that they employ in their teaching of Software Development definitely helps equip students with the ability to be able to pivot and meet any challenge that comes their way. Although, I do not feel like the next Bill gates, The Tech Academy definitely provided me with a nice starting ground in my life long learning within Software Development at Tech as a whole. </p><br>
<p> Below you will find some projects that I worked on as I was honing my skills at The Tech Academy. Please feel free to check out my <a href="https://codepen.io/rileyvaness/"> CodePen </a> as well if you are interested in exploring some of my front-end projects! </p>
